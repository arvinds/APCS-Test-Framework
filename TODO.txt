Somewhat in order of priority:
- write more test cases for FracCalc
- the shell scripts in the scripts/ directory might not be easy to modify and scale, maybe consider rewriting in python/ruby etc.
- create a scripts/run_all_tests.sh
- create a test fixutre for the VisCalc assignment
- figure out a way to turn the tests into html reports (this can be done with ANT: http://ideoplex.com/id/25/ant-and-junit, http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm, http://www.jaredrichardson.net/articles/junit-tutorial.html)
- add to webserver
    - logging (implement Log function)
    - multiple file upload
    - make login request(/proccesslogin) a POST instead of a GET so the pw doesnt show up in the URL
