Somewhat in order of priority:
- write more test cases for FracCalc
- the shell scripts in the scripts/ directory might not be easy to modify and scale, maybe consider rewriting in python/ruby etc.
- create a scripts/run_all_tests.sh
- create a test fixutre for the VisCalc assignment
- figure out a way to turn the tests into html reports (this can be done with ANT: http://ideoplex.com/id/25/ant-and-junit, http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm, http://www.jaredrichardson.net/articles/junit-tutorial.html)
- write a basic webserver to accept students programs, test them, generate html reports, and display them to the user. maybe enhance with these features
	- authentication(maybe just a special token for each student?)
	- both single and multiple file upload
